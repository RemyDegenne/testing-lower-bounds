# Monoidal composition `⊗≫` (composition up to associators)

We provide `f ⊗≫ g`, the `monoidalComp` operation,
which automatically inserts associators and unitors as needed
to make the target of `f` match the source of `g`.

## Example

Suppose we have a braiding morphism `R X Y : X ⊗ Y ⟶ Y ⊗ X` in a monoidal category, and that we
want to define the morphism with the type `V₁ ⊗ V₂ ⊗ V₃ ⊗ V₄ ⊗ V₅ ⟶ V₁ ⊗ V₃ ⊗ V₂ ⊗ V₄ ⊗ V₅` that
transposes the second and third components by `R V₂ V₃`. How to do this? The first guess would be
to use the whiskering operators `◁` and `▷`, and define the morphism as `V₁ ◁ R V₂ V₃ ▷ V₄ ▷ V₅`.
However, this morphism has the type `V₁ ⊗ ((V₂ ⊗ V₃) ⊗ V₄) ⊗ V₅ ⟶ V₁ ⊗ ((V₃ ⊗ V₂) ⊗ V₄) ⊗ V₅`,
which is not what we need. We should insert suitable associators. The desired associators can,
in principle, be defined by using the primitive three-components associator
`α_ X Y Z : (X ⊗ Y) ⊗ Z ≅ X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)` as a building block, but writing down actual definitions
are quite tedious, and we usually don't want to see them.

The monoidal composition `⊗≫` is designed to solve such a problem. In this case, we can define the
desired morphism as `𝟙 _ ⊗≫ V₁ ◁ R V₂ V₃ ▷ V₄ ▷ V₅ ⊗≫ 𝟙 _`, where the first and the second `𝟙 _`
are completed as `𝟙 (V₁ ⊗ V₂ ⊗ V₃ ⊗ V₄ ⊗ V₅)` and `𝟙 (V₁ ⊗ V₃ ⊗ V₂ ⊗ V₄ ⊗ V₅)`, respectively.
