% It will be used both by the web and the print version.
% It should *not* include the \begin{document}
%
% If you want to split the blueprint content into several files then
% the current file can be a simple sequence of \input. Otherwise It
% can start with a \section or \chapter for instance.

Warning: this document is a draft. Nothing in it is complete. It lacks references and content, its scope is not final, it will likely be reorganized several times and does not reflect the intended final version in any way.
